# Project - Team Collaboration App (with Redux)

## Overview

Use the concepts of redux, testing and optimization that you have learnt in the Sprint 6 to modify the Team Collaboration App that you have created in the previous sprint.

<br />

## Learning pre-requisites

Before you begin this session, kindly ensure that you have completed learning the following topics and solved the corresponding quizzes:

- The flow of Redux.

- Connecting Redux to React.
  
- Multiple reducers and combineReducers.

- Async actions in Redux.

- Jest and Enzyme.

- Minification and bundling.

- Code splitting and React Lazy.

- Large lists and react.window.

- Precaching in CRA.

- Pre-rendering routes.

- Web app manifests.

To complete the project successfully, ensure that you complete the following pre-requisites:

- External pre-requisite 1:

    You need to ensure that you have downloaded all the dependencies for Redux, Enzyme and Jest. Since we will be using React v16+, you also need to ensure that you have installed the Enzyme adapter for React.

- External pre-requisite 2:

    You have to clearly understand the differnce between ```shallow``` and ```mount```. Additionally, you also need to ensure that the components which you are planning to test should be exported separately as well. Moreover, you need to make sure how to test Redux + React applications using Jest and Enzyme.

- External pre-requisite 3:

  Since you will be creating a web application using React, we recommend you to install all the dependencies before you begin coding on your local machine. Ensure that the package.json has all the correct dependencies installed. Once all the dependencies are installed, calculate the number of components to be used and the hierarchy to be involved in it. Try to use reusable components as much as possible. 

  Accordingly, create the folder structure corresponding to the components you listed and add placeholder JS files in it.
  ***
  **As boilerplate, we are only providing you this readme file.**

  **The only requirement is ensure that irrespective of your method, you  set the default port value=3000(If you are using Create-React-App, that will be taken care of automatically, for other setups, make the necessary changes accordingly). Otherwise test cases will get stuck.**
    

```
NOTE: The basic user stories are the same as that of Sprint 5. However, the implementation differs.
To accomplish the below user stories, you need to ensure that a Redux store is created which is replenished with the latest data off the Firebase and there are actions-reducers which accomplish the user stories below.

After following all the  user stories and submitting your project successfully, you have to answer questions given in the form attached below:
```
[Sprint 6 Questionarre](https://forms.gle/ftWt8NuKk53kPHnV7): To be filled after you successfully submit the project


### User Story #1

User should be able to create a new board.

#### Details

You should create a component which shows a form to create a board. This form should be available as a 'new page' in SPA context, that is, on typing in the URL ```https://localhost:3000/createboard```, it should open the page with the form. There should also be a button on the navigation bar which will open this page.

![](https://github.com/greyatom-school/the-minerva-project/raw/master/FEWD/sprint_5/Project%20-%20Team%20Collaboration%20App/images/nav_bar.PNG)


The form should ask for the following inputs from the user:
- Name of the board(`input`element with id `name` and type `text`)

- Team members who will be a part of this board. (Member names should be separated by commas)(`input`element with id `team` and type `text`)

- Type of board (e.g. Design board, Testing board, etc.) [This should be an optional field](`input`element with id `type` and type `text`)

On clicking the <kbd>Create</kbd> button(`button` element with id `CreateBoard`) in the form, the details entered by the user should be added to a database on Firebase and the corresponding board should be shown on the home page.

**The above component should be re-created using TDD.**


### User Story #2

User should be able to view all his boards.

#### Details

The homepage which can be opened using the URL ```https://localhost:3000``` should show a list of all the boards that are created by the user.

If there are no boards created by the user, then the following message should be shown on the screen:
```
You haven't created any boards. Kindly click on the 'Create Board' button in the navigation bar to create a board.
```


On clicking a board, the user should be directed to the details of that particular board.

- Subtitle which should have the board name.
- Description (if any)
- Members name in circular representation with the initials.
- Due date.

Additionally, every card should have an ```Edit``` option as a button. Once the user clicks on Edit, a form pre-filled with the current information should be shown to the user for editing.



### User Story #7

User should be able to drag and drop a card from one column to another.


#### Details

Using the principles of HTML5's drag and drop functionality, the user should be able drag a card from one column and move it to another. If the user moves a card from, say, column A to column B, the card should no longer be seen in column A and it should only be seen in column B. Use Firebase to maintain a central data repository for achieving this.

### User Story #8

User should be able to archive and he should be able to delete a column or even a board.

#### Details

Buttons for deleting should be appropriately placed for every board allowing the user to delete it. 

Deleting board button should have text: `Delete Board`

![](https://github.com/greyatom-school/the-minerva-project/raw/master/FEWD/sprint_5/Project%20-%20Team%20Collaboration%20App/images/delete_boards.PNG)

On deletion, the same should be reflected on Firebase and inside the application.

### User Story #9

Optimise the application functionalities

#### Details

If you have noticed, we haven't included a specific task for optimization in any of the above user stories. We urge you to apply as many optimization techniques as applicable to the project.
